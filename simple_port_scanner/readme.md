# Simple Port Scanner

This is a very basic **TCP port scanner** without any multithreading or extensive error checking.  
It is intended that the user will provide a **correct IP address or hostname** as an argument, as no extensive error handling is done.

## Usage

```sh
chmod +x simple_port_scanner.py
./simple_port_scanner.py <ip_or_hostname>
